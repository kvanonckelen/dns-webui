## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvanonckelen/dns-webui.git
cd dns-webui
```

## Docker-compose file

```yml
services:
  dns-webui:
    image: kevinvobw/dns-webui
    container_name: dns-webui
    ports:
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./bind/etc:/etc/bind
      - ./nginx/certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Make sure you have created a volume where the nginx configuration files can be stored. 
If that is done, you can start the container.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit:

    http://localhost:8080 âž” Redirects automatically to https://localhost

Default credentials:

    Username: admin

    Password: admin123

    (Force password change required after first login)



## PORTS

## DEVELOPMENT

To generate your own self-signed SSL certificates:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes \
  -keyout nginx/certs/privkey.pem \
  -out nginx/certs/fullchain.pem \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
